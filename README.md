# RE3R SRT LiveSplit Component

## Description

This is a LiveSplit Component to integrate [SRT](https://github.com/Squirrelies/RE3REmakeSRT) with [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit). 

The goal is to "help" Speedrunners focus on the game and reduce eye movement by making DA, Health Points, and 
other info from SRT closer to Timer and other Pace info from LiveSplit.

**Note**: This is not a replacement for **SRT**. Actually it relies on `SRTHost.exe` that must be running in the 
background and listening on port `7190`.

## Usage

- Download and place the latest release of [`LiveSplit.RE3RSRT.dll`](https://github.com/mbnatafgi/LiveSplit.RE3R-SRT/releases) 
  in `LiveSplit/Components/` directory
- Start/Restart LiveSplit
- Right-click and select `Edit Layout...`
- Click `+` button and select `Other/RE3R SRT`
